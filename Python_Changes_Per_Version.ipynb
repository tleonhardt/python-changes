I may skip over things I haven't personally found useful or interesting. I'm also skipping over a slew of more minor changes present in each release. I may also cover something others view as minor if I have found it useful.\n",

    "- [Formatted string literals](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/inputoutput.html#formatted-string-literals) (better known as `f-strings`)\n",
    "    - A better option than `.format()` or `%` for string formatting that is more succinct, easier to read, and has better performance \n",
    "- [Underscores in numeric literals](https://docs.python.org/3/whatsnew/3.6.html#whatsnew36-pep515)\n",
    "    - Makes it easier to read large numbers\n",
    "- New [secrets](https://docs.python.org/3/library/secrets.html) library for generating cryptographically-secure random numbers\n",
    "    - Do not use `random` for generate secure random numbers\n",

    "- [asyncio](https://docs.python.org/3/library/asyncio.html#module-asyncio) module had a ton of improvements and is officially released; [asyncore](https://docs.python.org/3.11/library/asyncore.html) is deprecated (`asyncore` is finally removed in Python 3.12)"

If you aren't using the new python interactive interpreter or one of the new experimental versions, you likely won't notice much beyond tracebacks in color.\n",

    "- A new and better [interactive interpreter shell](https://docs.python.org/3/whatsnew/3.13.html#whatsnew313-better-interactive-interpreter) - still not as good as [ipython](https://ipython.org/)\n",
    "    - Multiline editing with history preservation\n",
    "    - Direct support for REPL-specific commands like help, exit, and quit, without the need to call them as functions\n",
    "    - Prompts and tracebacks with [color enabled by default](https://docs.python.org/3/using/cmdline.html#using-on-controlling-color)\n",
    "- Experimental support for running in a [free-threaded mode](https://docs.python.org/3/whatsnew/3.13.html#whatsnew313-free-threaded-cpython)\n",
    "    - With the global interpreter lock (GIL) disabled\n",
    "    - This is an experimental feature and therefore is not enabled by default\n",
    "    - The free-threaded mode requires a different executable, usually called `python3.13t` or `python3.13t.exe`\n",
    "- Experimental support for a [just-in-time (JIT) compiler](https://docs.python.org/3/whatsnew/3.13.html#whatsnew313-jit-compiler)\n",
    "    - When CPython is configured and built using the --enable-experimental-jit option, a just-in-time (JIT) compiler is added\n",
    "    - May speed up some Python programs \n",

    "### Improvements in 3.13\n",

    "\n",
    "- [Template string](https://docs.python.org/3.14/whatsnew/3.14.html#pep-750-template-strings) literals (t-strings) are a generalization of f-strings, using a `t` in place of the `f` prefix\n",
    "    - Instead of evaluating to `str`, t-strings evaluate to a new `string.templatelib.Template` type\n",
    "    - The template can then be combined with functions that operate on the template’s structure to produce a `str` or a string-like result, for example a sanitized version\n",
    "    - Compared to using an f-string, the function operating on it has access to template attributes containing the original information: static strings, interpolations, and values from the original scope\n",
    "- [Deferred evaluation of annotations](https://docs.python.org/3.14/whatsnew/3.14.html#pep-649-and-749-deferred-evaluation-of-annotations)\n",
    "    - The [annotations](https://docs.python.org/3.14/glossary.html#term-annotation) on functions, classes, and modules are no longer evaluated eagerly\n",
    "    - Instead, annotations are stored in special-purpose [annotate functions](https://docs.python.org/3.14/glossary.html#term-annotate-function) and evaluated only when necessary\n",
    "    - This change is designed to make annotations in Python more performant and more usable in most circumstances\n",
    "- A [new type of interpreter](https://docs.python.org/3.14/whatsnew/3.14.html#whatsnew314-tail-call) that uses tail calls between small C functions that implement individual Python opcodes\n",
    "    - For certain newer compilers, this interpreter provides significantly better performance\n",
    "    - Preliminary numbers suggest anywhere up to 30% faster Python code, and a geometric mean of 3-5% faster on pyperformance depending on platform and architecture\n",
    "    - This interpreter currently only works with Clang 19 and newer on x86-64 and AArch64 architectures; however, we expect that a future release of GCC will support this as well\n",
    "\n",
    "### Improvements in 3.14\n",
    "\n",
    "- New [annotationlib](https://docs.python.org/3.14/library/annotationlib.html) module provides tools for inspecting deferred annotations\n",
    "- New [compression.zstd](https://docs.python.org/3.14/library/compression.zstd.html) module for [Zstandard](https://github.com/facebook/zstd) support\n",
    "- [Syntax highlighting in PyREPL](https://docs.python.org/3.14/whatsnew/3.14.html#whatsnew314-pyrepl-highlighting), and color output in [unittest](https://docs.python.org/3.14/whatsnew/3.14.html#whatsnew314-color-unittest), [argparse](https://docs.python.org/3.14/whatsnew/3.14.html#whatsnew314-color-argparse), [json](https://docs.python.org/3.14/whatsnew/3.14.html#whatsnew314-color-json) and [calendar](https://docs.python.org/3.14/whatsnew/3.14.html#whatsnew314-color-calendar) modules"
